<h2>Exploratory Analysis: COVID-19 Rates &amp; Vaccinations</h2>
<p><img src="Data-Exploration_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>This plot shows the weekly case rate by NYC borough, beginning the week starting on August 9, 2020. The plot shows a similar trend in weekly rates across all 5 boroughs. Cases peaked for all boroughs from January through February of 2021. Boroughs experienced a smaller peak in cases in April 2021. Thereafter, case rates were significantly lower from April 2021 onwards, coinciding with the period of eligibility for NYC adults to be vaccinated against Covid-19.</p>
<p><br><br />
# Borough by sex, age, and race <img src="Data-Exploration_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" /><img src="Data-Exploration_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-2.png" width="90%" /><img src="Data-Exploration_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-3.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>The chart in Plot A shows aggregate counts for case, hospitalization and death counts for Covid 19 delineated by sex for all boroughs. It is clear that Queens, Brooklyn and Bronx have the highest aggregate counts in that order of decreasing magnitude. This pattern may explain the clustering of vaccination locations in these boroughs that we explore in subsequent paragraphs. It also noted that the counts for males are consistently higher than for females among all boroughs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The chart in Plot B shows aggregate counts for case, hospitalization and death counts for Covid 19 delineated by arbitrarily defined age brackets for all boroughs.The greatest concentration of aggregate counts is consistently in the 18-44 and 45-64 year old age bracket which together constitute early and mid adulthood. This is against the general perception that Covid-19 predominantly affects the elderly. This bears significance in public health communication to the public with regards to risk perception.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The chart in Plot C shows aggregate counts for case, hospitalization and death counts for Covid 19 delineated by arbitrarily defined race. The chart shows that the greatest burden of the aggregate measures is in the non-white population, lending further credence to the underlying racial disparities in Covid-19 outcomes and the disproportionate burden of the disease.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="Data-Exploration_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" /><img src="Data-Exploration_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-2.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>These plots show the percent of adults partially and fully vaccinated by borough, as of December 2021. The partially vaccinated plot excluded outliers greater than 30% and the fully vaccinated plot excluded outliers greater than 100%, as they were not representative of the dataset and may have been included erroneously. The median full-vaccination rate is greater than 75% for each borough, with Queens, Manhattan, and Staten Island having the highest full-vaccination rates, respectively. Interestingly, while Staten Island has one of the higher vaccination rates, it is consistently the borough with the highest case rate out of all the boroughs. When we examine the partially and fully vaccinated rates cumulatively, each borough is at least 80% vaccinated.</p>
