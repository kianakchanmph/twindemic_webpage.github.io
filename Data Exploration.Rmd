During our exploratory analysis, we first examined COVID-19 and influenza case and vaccine trends separately to better understand the data we were working with. 

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(haven)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(leaflet)


knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

### Data Cleaning

Loading the COVID data from NYC Health.
```{r, message = FALSE}

```
From the datasets above, we will likely compare the following pairs: caserate/hosprate/testrate_by_zip; data/doses_by_day; vax_by_boro_age/demo



Cleaning caserate_by_zip:

  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(age_group %in% c("'18-24", "'25-34", "'35-44", "'45-54", "'55-64", "'65-74", "'75-84", "'85+") )

## Exploratory Analysis: COVID-19 Rates & Vaccinations
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
caserate_by_boro_plot = 
  caserate_by_boro %>% 
  filter(boro != "city") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week_ending, y = case_rate, color = boro)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Weekly Case Rate by Borough",
    x = "",
    y = "Case Rate"
  )

caserate_by_boro_plot
```
COVID-19 
This plot shows the weekly case rate by NYC borough, beginning the week starting on August 9, 2020. The plot shows a similar trend in weekly rates across all 5 boroughs. Cases peaked for all boroughs from January through February of 2021. Boroughs experienced a smaller peak in cases in April 2021. Thereafter, case rates were significantly lower from April 2021 onwards, coinciding with the period of eligibility for NYC adults to be vaccinated against Covid-19.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
partial_vax_plot =
  vax_by_zip_adults_df %>% 
  filter(perc_partially < 30) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, y = perc_partially, fill = boro)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Percent adults partially vaccinated by borough, as of 12/7/2021",
    x = "",
    y = "Percent partially vaccinated"
  )

full_vax_plot =
  vax_by_zip_adults_df %>% 
  filter(perc_fully < 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, y = perc_fully, fill = boro)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Percent adults fully vaccinated by borough, as of 12/7/2021",
    x = "",
    y = "Percent fully vaccinated"
  )

partial_vax_plot
full_vax_plot
```

These plots show the percent of adults partially and fully vaccinated by borough, as of December 2021. The partially vaccinated plot excluded outliers greater than 30% and the fully vaccinated plot excluded outliers greater than 100%, as they were not representative of the dataset and may have been included erroneously. The median full-vaccination rate is greater than 75% for each borough, with Queens, Manhattan, and Staten Island having the highest full-vaccination rates, respectively. Interestingly, while Staten Island has one of the higher vaccination rates, it is consistently the borough with the highest case rate out of all the boroughs. When we examine the partially and fully vaccinated rates cumulatively, each borough is at least 80% vaccinated.

We then took a look at our flu data:
Loading NYC Locations Providing Seasonal Flu Vaccinations/ Emergency Department Visits and Admissions for Influenza-like Illness/ Census Selected Social Characteristics

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

flu_vaxx_loc = read_csv("./data/New_York_City_Locations_Providing_Seasonal_Flu_Vaccinations.csv")

census_social = read_csv("./data/censuszip_selected_social_characterisitcs_new.csv")

```

 
# Data Cleaning 2
Cleaning flu_vaxx_loc:
```{r}

flu_vaxx_byzipcode =
  flu_vaxx_loc %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(walk_in:zip_code, location) %>%
  filter(borough != "YONKERS") %>%
  group_by(zip_code) %>%
  summarize(n_loc = n()) #to get the total number of vax locations by zipcode

flu_vaxx_byboro =
    flu_vaxx_loc %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    mutate(borough = toupper(borough)) %>%
    filter(borough != "YONKERS") %>%
    group_by(borough) %>%
    summarize(n_loc_boro = n()) #to get the total number of vax locations by zipcode

```

 

## Exploratory Analysis
```{r}
ggplot(flu_vaxx_byboro, aes(x = borough, y = n_loc_boro, fill = borough)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Locations Providing
  Seasonal Flu Vaccinations in NYC",
    x = "Boroughs of NYC",
    y = "Number of Locations Providing Seasonal Flu Vaccinations"
