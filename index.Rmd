#### Motivation
As we enter the influenza season this Winter while continuing to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a continued urgency from public health and government officials alike, to encourage New Yorkers to get vaccinated for both influenza and COVID-19. This year in particular, experts are concerned that this year's flu season may be even more severe, due to an unusually mild season last year (Spantideas et al, 2021). Now, with the rise of a new COVID variant, city and public health leaders are pushing for mandatory vaccination requirements and continued COVID-19 precautions to prepare for a potential “Twindemic,” or the simultaneous outbreak of influenza and COVID-19. A Twindemic has the potential to crowd emergency rooms, threaten the public health of our communities, and burden our healthcare system. Therefore, for this project, we seek to conduct an exploratory analysis between COVID-19 and influenza in New York City.  Specifically, we will examine the relationship between COVID-19 and influenza uptake by zip code and sociodemographic factors in New York City through data visualizations and regression analyses.

#### Related Work
New York City was the epicenter of  COVID-19 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12,589.2 cases and 404.5 deaths per 100,000 residents recorded in September of 2021 (Moreland et al., 2021). Recently, alongside entering the winter season and the emergence of yet another COVID-19 variant, news outlets and academic sources alike have warned of a threat of a Twindemic. The urgency to get vaccinated for not only COVID-19, but also influenza, is prevalent now more than ever among city officials and public health professionals to curb the spread of two infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic shed light on stark racial/ethnic health disparities related to COVID-19 illness and mortality. Furthermore, vaccine hesitancy has exacerbated these disparities, with more people of color disproportionately affected. We aim for the results of our analyses of the COVID-19 and influenza trends in New York City to inform public health programs and policies to improve vaccination efforts to vulnerable communities.
