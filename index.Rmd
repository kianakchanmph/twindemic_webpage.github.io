# Learn about our Project
As we enter the influenza season this Winter while continuing to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a continued urgency from public health and government officials alike, to encourage New Yorkers to get vaccinated for both influenza and COVID-19. This year in particular, experts are concerned that this year's flu season may be even more severe, due to an unusually mild season last year (Spantideas et al, 2021). Now, with the rise of a new COVID variant, city and public health leaders are pushing for mandatory vaccination requirements and continued COVID-19 precautions to prepare for a potential “Twindemic,” or the simultaneous outbreak of influenza and COVID-19. A Twindemic has the potential to crowd emergency rooms, threaten the public health of our communities, and burden our healthcare system. Therefore, for this project, we seek to conduct an exploratory analysis between COVID-19 and influenza in New York City.  Specifically, we will examine the relationship between COVID-19 and influenza uptake by zip code and sociodemographic factors in New York City through data visualizations and regression analyses.
